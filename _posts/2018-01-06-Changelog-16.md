## Welcome to LineageOS’ regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since December 5th

- Jelly
  - Favourites management has been revamped
  - HTTP Authentication dialog can now be dismissed
- Webview for LineageOS 14.1 has been updated to Chromium 63.0.3239.111
- December security patches have been merged for LineageOS 13.0 and 14.1
- Added some more sensitive numbers for Canada and corrected a typo for a US one
- Snap will now automatically recognise and process QR codes


### LineageOS 15.1

Quick updates:
- lineage-15.0 has been locked (no new changes to go on here), and work is being done on our staging/lineage-15.1
- Many features have been ported over so we're mainly now looking at the best way to transfer some important settings when you upgrade from cm-14.1 to lineage-15.1

Like always, we won’t be giving any indication as to when we might be close to a releasable product, but keep waiting patiently, and as we reach big milestones, we'll be giving you some more status updates.

### Infrastructure

A couple of our infrastructure repos have been moved from the [LineageOS organisation](https://github.com/LineageOS) to the [LineageOS-Infra organisation](https://github.com/lineageos-infra) on GitHub
