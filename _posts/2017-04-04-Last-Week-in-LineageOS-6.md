## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### April Fool's
We're glad so many of you have enjoyed (and fallen for) our April Fool's antics. 

To be absolutely clear:

* VoLTE is the name of our (temporary) mascot (who is retiring on Friday). If you haven't seen it yet, check out our [blog post](http://lineageos.org/Announcing-our-Mascot/).
* br0zip is a harmless just-for-fun app shipping on LineageOS 14.1 builds from 3rd April to 7th April (_Disclaimer: It does not actually produce functional ROMs_)
* VoLTE, our mascot, is also in the bootanimation on LineageOS 14.1 builds from 3rd April to 7th April

### Major changes since 20th March
* Wiki refresh! Our wiki now has a brand new material design, courtesy of Aykut Yilmaz. We've also made the URLs a bit prettier and reorganised a few pages. [Check it out](http://wiki.lineageos.org)
* New gallery app
  * Easier navigation between timeline, albums and videos
  * Fullscreen video playback
* Made LineageOS Updater more reliable. It should no longer corrupt or break downloads under certain circumstances
* New floating button in the Recorder app: You can now choose _when_ to begin a screen recording. Pressing record will create a floating view, from which you can begin the recording.
* [YOLO](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/topic:YOLO)
