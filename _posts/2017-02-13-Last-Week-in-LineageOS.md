Lots of people have been asking for changelogs, so we'll be making one for people who don't want to trawl through Gerrit.
If you want to know everything that's changed in the last week or so, check [our Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org). We will refrain from adding changes for each device, as this would take  too much time. Instead, things that have changed for everybody, new devices added to the roster, or __major__ changes to devices (eg cm13->cm14.1, or massive breaking bug has been fixed) will be reported.

## What's changed then?
* Removed AOSP Soundrecorder and CyanogenMod Screen Recorder, which have been replaced with our homegrown app, dubbed "Recorder". This handles both sound and screen recording
* ~~CM~~ Lineage Wallpapers have returned
* New touchscreen gestures interface for devices that support it with customizable actions
* A new website design, courtesy of [Aykut Yilmaz](https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/160330/)
