## Welcome to LineageOS’ regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since April 1st

### Infrastructure

#### CVE Tracker

The LineageOS CVE Tracker has been made private for contributors because of the unreliability of the provided data.
We're working on a remedy but until it's ready non-contributors won't be able to see the status of the devices.

#### Code of conduct

Project Directors have unanimously adopted a Code of Conduct for all project contributors (Directors included) to measure against.
The CoC can be found on in the Charter project: https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md
We feel that this is an integral part of keeping this project a fun and safe place to work and collaborate.
This also provides a mechanism, via the Directors email alias, to address specific concerns and bad actors,
and nip issues in the bud before they poison the overall experience.
It's important to note that we don't intend to police your ability to have fun or joke around - however,
we should all be conscious that what one finds funny can be hurtful or harmful to another.
As we continue to grow and bring in new faces, this should help define what it means to work with professionalism for folks new and old.
