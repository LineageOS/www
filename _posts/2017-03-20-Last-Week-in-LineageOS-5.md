## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### It's over 1 million!

Our installation counter has ticked over the 1 million mark.  
Note that the installation counter is not a 100% accurate reflection of users, by design. Since we don't actually track devices or users, we use the randomized installation ID, which gets switched each time you wipe your device. So depending on some users' patterns, 1 physical device could count as multiple installations if they wiped that many times.  
Regardless, we're all very proud of the reception we've received and thank you for all of your continued support.

### Major changes since 6th March
* Contacts can now be stored locally regardless of whether a contacts provider exists ([contact-local-storage](http://review.lineageos.org/#/q/topic:contact-local-storage))
