## Welcome to LineageOS' weekly review, where we go over changes in the past week

### Major changes since 27th Feb 2017
* Addon SU for LineageOS 13.0 is fixed ([addon-su-13](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/topic:addon-su-13+(status:open+OR+status:merged)))
* Single Hand Mode has arrived! ([oneHand](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/status:merged+branch:cm-14.1+topic:oneHand))
    * This feature is enabled in all LineageOS 14.1 builds from 6th March 2017. To use it on devices with on-screen navigation buttons, swipe right or left on the home button. On devices with hardware keys, you can set the trigger for this mode in 'Settings > Buttons'
    * Take a look at a video of it in action:
