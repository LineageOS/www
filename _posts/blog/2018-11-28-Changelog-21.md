## Welcome to LineageOS' regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since September 17th

* Updated timezone data to 2018g on both 14.1 and 15.1 branches. This was done to reflect changes made in some countries regarding time zones.
* More countries have been enabled for call recording. Remember that even if this feature is enabled, you are responsible for complying with your local laws regarding call recording.
* The system profile tile is back on 15.1
* Added support for AC3 audio tracks in matroska (.mkv) video files.
* Chromium webview has been updated to version 69.0.3497.109 on both 15.1 and 14.1.
* November security patches have been merged in 15.1.
* October security patches have been merged in both 15.1 and 14.1 branches.

### LineageOS 16.0

You may have noticed development has slowed down on 14.1 and 15.1. We have been working hard
to prepare the next iteration of LineageOS, based on Android 9 Pie.

We have almost reached feature parity with 15.1, so now it's time for several devices to get
ready for official builds; in fact, most of the remaining work is just related to make old
hardware work with the newer Android version.

We don't have an estimated date for delivering the first builds, but we can tell you we
are getting closer.

### Infrastructure

#### Website

As per your suggestions in the Summer Survey we have improved our website to be more user friendly
and contain more information about the main features and goals of LineageOS. The blog has
been moved to https://lineageos.org/blog although the last article is still visible from the
home page.

#### Builds

We have received new hardware! Thanks to everyone who's contributed to make this happen
(including OSU Open Source Labs, Academic Computer Club at Ume√• University, and dotsrc.org).

Now, it takes us about 10 hours to build a round of builds. We have consulted a specialized group of
mathematicians, and they've informed us there are more than 10 hours in a day.
Hopefully this is accurate, we don't really trust them.

The current main branch (15.1 as of now) will get daily builds, older branches such as 14.1 will
get either weekly or monthly builds, depending on the amount of activity on the branch.

While 15.1 builds don't receive so many changes in a single day, we're taking this as an opportunity
to make sure our infrastructure will hold well when 16.0 comes.

For 14.1 builds we have set a monthly release cycle as this branch is going to be deprecated in a
foreseeable future and yet we're ready to ship extraordinaries builds in case of
important security fixes.

Note that thee change on our side to daily builds does not translate in the need of upgrading
daily on your end too: the beauty of daily builds is that whether you'd like to
upgrade every day, 2 days, once in a week, twice a month or once in a month, you can always do it
as it pleases your needs.

We took this occasion to modernize (and open source) our build process too: we've moved away from
a Jenkins instance in favor of [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/builder/lineage_builder).
You can see the current status of the build bots at https://builds.lineageos.org.

While we have moved some parts of our infrastructure to GitLab, we won't be moving away from
GitHub as a code mirror. We also can't mirror our code to GitLab right now due to an open
GitLab bug that's preventing some repositories from mirroring.

#### Gerrit

Our gerrit instance for code review has been updated to version 2.16.

#### Jira

In the coming weeks, we will be moving away from Jira for bug tracking. GitLab issues fits our use
case very well, is easier to manage, and reduces the need of another server to run Jira.
There's some development work that needs to be done to automate issue collection.

### Summer Survey

We have [published the results]({{ site.baseurl }}/Summer-Survey-2-Results/) of the second Summer
Survey, check them out to see what our community told us.

### Build roster

This week we are dropping a huge number of 14.1 devices which maintainers are absent or not
interested in maintaining them anymore. To resume builds, anyone can start submitting patches to
gerrit and eventually step up as a maintainer.
