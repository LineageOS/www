## Hello LineageOS-16.0

We've been working hard the last few months to bring our vision to this new version of android, and get it ready for you.
Thanks to major cleanup and refactoring done in the previous branch, we were
able to focus more on features and reliability this time: in particular both Privacy Guard
and the su addon received a decent amount of improvements.

Also, with some minor changes we made the [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html)
compatible with what will be the future default implementation of dark mode in Android. In the future
more and more third party apps will "support" tuning with the system style (dark/light) and you'll be able
to enjoy them right away.

As we announced when the [Summer Survey 2 results]({{site.baseurl}}/Summer-Survey-2-Results/) were posted, we will
be introducing new features to [Trust]({{site.baseurl}}/Trust-me/); we are beginning with the ability to block new USB
device connections when device is locked. Please note that this feature has to be enabled on a per-device basis due to the
layer at which this was implemented.

Builds, which have reached feature parity with the 15.1 branch, will begin rolling out as nightlies on the XXth January,
with 15.1 shifting to a monthly release schedule and 14.1 being removed from the build roster.

We will begin with a small selection of devices with more jumping later from previous branches.

### Upgrading to 16.0

We're starting our 16.0 builds with some devices (listed below), with others migrating sooner or later.

#### From official LineageOS 15.1

 1. (Optional) Make a backup of your important data
 2. Download the build either from [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) or built in updater app
   * You can export the downloaded package to the sdcard from the Updater app by long-pressing it and then selecting _"Export"_ in the popup menu
 3. Download proper addons packages ([GApps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html), [su](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)...) for Pie 9
 4. Make sure your recovery and firmware are up to date
 5. Boot into recovery mode
 6. Format your system partition
 7. Install the LineageOS 16.0 build
 8. If your device has an A/B partition scheme (check your [device's wiki page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) for more info), reboot to _RECOVERY_ now -- this may seem odd, but A/B devices require it. If not, proceed without rebooting
 9. Install all your addons _WITHOUT_ rebooting in between
 10. When you're done, reboot the device

Note that:

 * While you'll be able to download and export the update from the updater app, you won't be allowed to install a 16.0 build on the top of a 15.1 one by clicking the usual _"Install"_ button
 * Wiping data is _not_ needed when upgrading from an official build
 * Wiping data is _always_ needed when coming from something that's not an official build, regardless of the Android version. Refer to the instructions stated on the [wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices) page of your device.

## LineageOS 15.1 changelog

Note that all of these can be found in the new 16.0 branch too.

* Calculator now supports dark mode through [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html)
* Added "Mark as read" action in messages notifications
* Exchange support
* December 2018 and January 2019 security patches have been merged
* Webview has been updated to Chromium 71.0.3578.99

## Goodbye LineageOS 14.1

The Nougat-based release has been discontinued and the last builds were published on Jan XXth, 2019.
The branches will not be locked, so it’ll still be open for contributions such as security patches,
as the 13.0 and 11.0 branches that have been getting security patches backported by the community.
LineageOS 15.1 will remain under active development, but don’t expect new features to come since the
majority of the developers have jumped to the Pie branch.

## Infrastructure

As announced in the [previous blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-21/) we have moved away from Jira in favor of
[GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues) for bug reporting.

## Device changes

As for the [previous branch]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-16/) all the supported devices must meet all the
requirements stated in the [devices charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md).
