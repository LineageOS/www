## Hello LineageOS-16.0

We've been working hard these months to get this new version available.
Thanks to major cleanups and refactoring done in the previous branch, we were
able to focus more on features reliability this time: in particular both Privacy Guard
and the su addon received a decent amount of improvements.

With some minor changes we also made the [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html)
compatible with what will be the future default implementation of the dark mode on Android. In the future
more and more third party apps will "support" tuning with the system style (dark/light) and you'll be able
to enjoy it straight away.

As we announced when the [Summer Survey 2 results]({{site.baseurl}}/Summer-Survey-2-Results/) were posted, we will be introducing new  features to
[Trust]({{site.baseurl}}/Trust-me/): we are beginning with the possibility to block new USB gadgets connections
when device is locked. Note that this feature has to be enabled on a per-device basis due to the low level of
the implementation.

Builds, which have reached feature parity with the 15.1 branch, will begin rolling out as nightlies on the XXth January, with 15.1 shifting to a monthly release schedule and 14.1 being removed from the build roster.

We will begin with a small selection of devices with more jumping later from previous branches.

### Upgrading to 16.0

We're starting our 16.0 builds with some devices (listed below), with others migrating sooner or later.

#### From official LineageOS 15.1

 0. (Optional) Make a backup of your important data
 1. Download the build either from [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) or built in updater app
   * You can export the downloaded package to the sdcard from the Updater app by long-pressing it and then selecting _"Export"_ in the popup menu
 2. Download proper addons packages ([GApps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html), [su](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)...) for Pie 9
 3. Make sure your recovery and firmware are up to date
 4. Boot into recovery mode
 5. Format your system partition
 6. Install the LineageOS 16.0 build
 7. _[ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN A/B DEVICE]_ Reboot to **recovery** again
 8. Install all your addons _WITHOUT_ rebooting in between
 9. When you're done, reboot the device

Note that:

 * Wiping data is _not_ needed when upgrading from an official build
 * While you'll be able to download and export the update from the updater app, you won't be allowed to install a 16.0 build on the top of a 15.1 one by clicking the usual _"Install"_ button

If you are not running an **official** LineageOS 15.1 build, you need to follow the instructions
stated on the [wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices) page of your device.

Note that wiping data is _always_ needed when coming from something that's not an official build,
regardless of the Android version

## Older version changes

Note that all of these can be found in the new 16.0 branch too.

* Calculator now supports dark mode through [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html)
* Added "Mark as read" action in messages notifications
* Exchange support has been enabled in 15.1 too
* December 2018 and January 2019 security patches have been merged
* Webview has been updated to Chromium 71.0.3578.99

## Goodbye LineageOS 14.1

The Nougat-based release has been discontinued and the last builds were published on Jan XXth, 2019.
The branches will not be locked, so it’ll still be open for contributions such as security patches,
as the 13.0 and 11.0 branches that have been getting security patches backported from the community.
LineageOS 15.1 will remain under active development, but don’t expect new features to come since the
majority has jumped to the Pie branch.

## Infrastructure

As announced in the [previous blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-21/) we have moved away from Jira in favor of
[GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues) for bug reporting.

## Device changes

As for the [previous branch]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-16/) all the supported devices must meet all the
requirements stated in the [devices charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md).
