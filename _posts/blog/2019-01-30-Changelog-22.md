## Hello LineageOS 16.0

We've been working hard the last few months to bring our vision to this new version of Android,
and get it ready for you.
Thanks to major cleanup and refactoring done in the previous branch, we were
able to focus more on features and reliability this time: in particular, both Privacy Guard
and the su addon received a decent amount of improvements.

With some minor changes made to the [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html), it is now
compatible with what will eventually become the default implementation of dark mode in Android.
In the future, more and more third party apps will follow the system style, meaning our Styles API
will allow you to have a more coherent experience across apps.

As we announced when the [Summer Survey 2 results]({{site.baseurl}}/Summer-Survey-2-Results/) were posted,
we will be introducing new features to [Trust]({{site.baseurl}}/Trust-me/),
beginning with the ability to block new USB device connections when device is locked.
Please note that this feature has to be enabled on a per-device basis due to the
layer at which this was implemented.

Builds, which have reached feature parity with the 15.1 branch, will be rolling out as
nightlies on the XXth January.

LineageOS 16.0 will be launching with a small selection of devices. More will be added
shortly as maintainers have time to update them.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 16.0

We're starting our 16.0 builds with some devices (listed below), with others migrating sooner or later.

 1. (Optional) Make a backup of your important data
 2. Download the build either from [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) or built in updater app
   * You can export the downloaded package to the sdcard from the Updater app by long-pressing it and then selecting _"Export"_ in the popup menu
 3. Download proper addons packages ([GApps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html), [su](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)...) for Pie 9
 4. Make sure your recovery and firmware are up to date
 5. Follow the "Installing LineageOS from recovery" section [on your device's installation page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html)

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device.

If you are installing from an unofficial build, you *MUST* wipe data from recovery before installing.

## LineageOS 15.1 and 16.0 changelog

* It's now possible to set custom automatic update check intervals in the updater (never / once a day, once a week / once a month)
* Calculator now supports dark mode through [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html)
* Added "Mark as read" action in messages notifications
* Exchange support
* December 2018 and January 2019 security patches have been merged
* Webview has been updated to Chromium 71.0.3578.99

## Goodbye LineageOS 14.1

The Nougat-based release has been discontinued and the last builds were published on Jan XXth, 2019.
The branches will not be locked, so it’ll still be open for contributions such as security patches,
as the 13.0 and 11.0 branches that have been getting security patches backported by the community.
LineageOS 15.1 will remain under active development, but don’t expect new features to come since the
majority of the developers have jumped to the Pie branch.

## Infrastructure

As announced in the [previous blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-21/) we have moved away from Jira in favor of
[GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues) for bug reporting.

The [wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org) has received a visual update to match the main website.

LineageOS 16.0 translations are available in [Crowdin](https://wiki.lineageos.org/translate-howto.html)
for those who'd like to contribute by translating LineageOS into their native language.

## Device changes

As for the [previous branch]({{site.baseurl}}/Changelog-16/), all the supported devices must meet all the
requirements stated in the [devices charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md).
