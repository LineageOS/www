## Wow, LineageOS 19!

As always, welcome back! When we wrote our post last year, I think many of us had thought we wouldn't be giving the same "trying times"
spiel we gave last year, but c'est la vie. From our family to yours, we hope you're navigating the pandemics and accompanying disasters
as swiftly and safely as possible!

With that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android 12's release last October to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google's fairly large changes in Android 11, we were able to rebase our changes onto Android 12 much more
efficiently. This led to a lot of time to spend on cool new features, as well as adapt our additions to Android 12's new [Material You](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) design language!

Now, let's talk about versioning conventions - To match AOSP's versioning conventions, we are dropping our subversion from a branding perspective.

As Android has moved onto the quarterly maintainence release model, this release will be "LineageOS 19", not 19.0 or 19.1.

### New Features!

* Security patches from March 2021 to March 2022 have been merged to LineageOS 15.1 through 19.
  * 19 builds are currently based on the android-12.0.1_r1 tag, which is the Qualcomm Pixel series tag.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 96.0.4664.104.

* (18.1 too) Wi-Fi display is available for all devices which choose to opt-in, via either the Qualcomm proprietary interface, or the newly restored legacy Miracast interface!
* (18.1 too) We now support custom charging sounds for different types of charging, cabled, or wireless.

### Android Automotive!

Thanks to the hard works of contributors Tom Pratt, and Al Sutton, LineageOS now supports building targeting both Android Automotive devices, and generic Automotive builds!

Note that this is Android Automotive, not the mobile device dependent Android Auto. You can read more about the difference [here](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive), but in essence, Android Automotive is a fully standalone car infotainment OS with extensible controls for common car peripherals.

Following the guide linked below, you can build an Automotive GSI and try it for yourself!

### Networking Restrictions

Our very popular privacy oriented built-in firewall, restricted networking mode, and per app data isolation features were all rewritten to account for AOSP's new restricted networking mode and [BPF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html).

Additionally, data restrictions and network isolation features were merged into a single implementation.

Combined, this means that one of our largest pain points each bringup should now be easier to forward port in future revisions!

### Devboard support!

In an effort to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, we now support a variety of development boards, some officially and some unofficially.

The unofficial targets may at some point become official, but have small things that need to be worked out. You'll be on your own to install the builds on unofficial devices for now.

The officially supported devices include:
- NVidia Jetson TX1 - foster, foster_tab
- NVidia Jetson Nano (2G) - porg, porg_tab
- NVidia Jetson TX2 (NX) - quill, quill_tab

The unofficially supported devices include:
- Bannana Pi M5 - m5
- NVidia Jetson AGX Xavier (NX) - galen, galen_tab
- Odroid C4 - odroidc4
- Radxa Zero - radxa0

### Let's talk about legacy devices...

Bad news lies ahead, sadly. I know many of you were expecting the usual myriad of legacy devices to surprise you with a 19 release, and although they _can_, at the moment they won't be.

This is due to AOSP's removal of `iptables` in favor of [eBPF](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf). This is a newer, much more efficient kernel side implementation.

The issue lies in the fact that only devices with Linux kernel 4.9 or newer have the needed capabilities to make use of eBPF. Usually, these things can be backported to older kernel versions, but at the moment, even something as close to version 4.9 as 4.4 proved challenging due to the sheer number of commits and structure changes in BPF's introduction. Those of you on a 4.4 kernel, fear not, a backport has been created, but for devices using kernel versions 3.18 and below this may be the end of the road.

Additionally, `iptables` can't be restored in any meaningful way, which makes things all the harder. At the moment, with some hacky workarounds (that we won't be merging, as they break packet filtering, etc.) legacy devices can boot, but until a proper workaround/backport of BPF is brought to older kernel versions, don't expect legacy devices to ship LineageOS 19.

### Deprecations

On the whole, we feel that the 19 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 18.1 and is ready for initial release.

LineageOS 17.1 builds stopped on January 31st, 2022, to allow space on our infrastructure to begin testing LineageOS 19.

LineageOS 19 will launch building for a fairly small selection of devices, mainly Google Pixel devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 19

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) as given the complexity introduced AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab) found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of 16.0, maintainers have
been expected to run through the full instructions, and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's individual installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official, but no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you review it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission, and if it's up to par, invited to our communications
instances, and your device forked to LineageOS's official repos.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other thing you can contribute to:
for instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

### Generic Targets

We've talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, in an effort to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html)! This >

Additionally, these same targets can now be used to build GSI's in mobile, Automotive (we'll talk more about this later), and Android TV configurations, making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user-experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach us out on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
