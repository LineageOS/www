### 22 - Cheers to the Next Level!

Hey there! Welcome back!

This year, we're running way ahead of schedule, thanks to a boost in contributors, reinvigorated passion of others, and the new project leads joining the fold.

We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September, adapting our unique features to this new version of Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to rebase onto Android 15's codebase faster than anticipated.

Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up this early in the cycle!

Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to introduce not one, but two new
exciting apps! The first one, Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
Camelot, will let you view PDF files.

### Versioning Reminders

As always, while we're aligned with AOSP's versioning, but Android's move to trunk-based development, and the subsequent growth in size of Android's QPRs (Quarterly Platform Releases) have made our job magnitudes harder! As a byproduct we have to rebase our entire code-base every 3 months. Sadly, Google also has a habit of introducing deprecations, or outright removing code that older devices rely on with little advanced notice during these. Due to the fact that these older devices may lose support mid-cycle, we have opted to restore the dot versioning to our branding. This lauch will be LineageOS 22_.1_, with every QPR rebased upreving that sub-version by `.1`, so expect to see 22.2 as well.

Going forward, this aligns well with Google's newly introduced concept of [minor SDK releases](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/10/android-sdk-release-update.html). Now, you'll be able to distinguish the minor version of Android you're installing. Assuming the 25Q4 release is Android 16 QPR2, it should correspond to LineageOS 23_.2_, and so on.

Additionally, maintainers will also be expected to check-in at each QPR to assure that their device still functions will all the changes carried. Don't be disheartened if your device falls out of support during a QPR, it may just take some time to bring it up to par!

Welcome to LineageOS 22.1, based on Android 15 QPR1. Enjoy the new features, and, as always, happy flashing!

### New Features!

* Security patches from March 2024 to November 2024 have been merged to LineageOS 19.1 through 22.1.
* SeedVault and Etar have both been updated to their newest respective upstream version.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 131.0.6778.200.
* Contributor demon000 (Cosmin Tanislav) has reworked our extract utilities, heavily optimizing them. He was able to optimize most devices down from ~180 seconds to extract, all the way down to roughly ~30 seconds.
  * He also rewrote our extract utilities from scratch in Python, making them far more extensible, and even faster, clocking in closer to 6 seconds! A 30x speed improvement! Maintainers can swap to this implementation at their leisure throughout this cycle.
* Contributor 0xCAFEBABE also added support for virtIO (QEMU/crosvm/UTM, etc.) targets! Though these aren't supported officially, there is an awesome, comprehensive guide for building and utilizing these targets on [the Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu).

### New App?

![twelve]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2024-12-31/twelve.webp){: .blog_post_image_content }

Our default music app, Eleven, has been included since CyanogenMod 12.1, making it one of the oldest
apps in the LineageOS apps suite. Unfortunately, as you might have noticed, it has been neglected
for quite some time. Given its age, its codebase was also old and not compliant with modern
Android's guidelines.

So we took the opportunity to replace it with a new music app, Twelve. Is this yet another music
app? Yeah, it is, but we promise we made sure to provide a nice out-of-the-box experience for
LineageOS users that aren't looking for more advanced alternatives. It will be available starting
from LineageOS 22.1 and onwards.

Twelve includes all the features you're used to from Eleven, plus:
- A modern Material You design
- Proper landscape and tablets experience
- **Support for most of the existing music library server protocols**
  - Subsonic
  - OpenSubsonic (Ampache, Navidrome, Nextcloud Music, etc.)
  - Jellyfin
- Support for streaming protocols like HLS, DASH, and SmoothStreaming
- Improved search
- Improved Android Auto support
- Playback resumption support (either from a device reboot or a new Bluetooth connection)
- More Visualizer presets
- Skip silence option

We're also planning to add more features in the future, you'll see them appear as you keep your
device up-to-date, stay tuned!

### Another new app!?

Yes, you've heard that right, despite being less interesting than Twelve.

Starting from LineageOS 22.1, the OS will bundle a native reader app for PDF files which,
surprisingly, Jelly (our browser app) and WebViews cannot handle (for now).

The app uses the same Jetpack PDF library used on recent Google Chrome and Files by Google releases,
so there's really nothing outstanding to mention about it: it's just a simple PDF reader, have fun
reading your very important documents!

### Careful Commonization

Several of our developers have worked hard on SoC-specific common kernels to base on that can be merged on a somewhat regular basis to pull in the latest features/security patches to save maintainers additional effort.

Go check them out and consider basing your device kernels on them!

Supported SoCs right now are:

{: .table }
| SoC (system-on-chip) | Kernel Version | Android Version |
|------------------|------|
| Qualcomm MSM8998/MSM8996 | [4.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8998) | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm MSM8953 | [4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8953)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SDM845 | [4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm845)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8150 | [4.14](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8150) | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SDM660 | [4.19](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm660) | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8250 | [4.19](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8250) | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8350 | [5.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8350)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8450 | [5.10](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8450)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8550 | [5.15](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8550)  | 13, 14, 15 |

Additionally, many legacy devices require interpolating libraries that we colloquially refer to as "shims" - these have long been device and maintainer managed, but this cycle we have decided to commonize them to make the effort easier on everyone and not duplicate effort!

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_compat) and contribute shims that you think other devices may need or add additional components to additional shims and compatibility layers provided via Gerrit!

### Deprecations

Overall, we feel that the 22.1 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 21 and is ready for initial release.

We will allow new LineageOS 20 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we no longer will allow newly submitted LineageOS 20 devices to ship.

LineageOS 22.1 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 22.1

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) and then on "Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS".

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) by clicking on your device and then on "Installation".

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Download portal

While it has been in the making for quite a while and already released a year ago, it's still news in regards to this blog post.
Our [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) has been redesigned and also gained a few functional improvements:
- Dark mode
- Downloads of additional images (shown for all devices but not used on all of them, read the instructions to know which ones you need for your device's installation!)
- Verifying downloaded files (see [here](https://download.lineageos.org/verify)) - if you go with any download not obtained from us, you can still verify it was originally
  signed by us and thus untampered with

A reminder: Follow the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) to the letter! If an image is listed on the download portal that the wiki doesn't ask you to use, ignore it! It is likely there so the maintainer can point power-users at it if needed.

### Wiki

The [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has also been expanded throughout the year and now offers, in addition to the known and tested instructions for all supported devices, some improvements:
- The device overview allows filtering for various attributes you might be interested in a device (please note: choosing a device only based on that list still does
  not guarantee any device support beyond the point of when you chose it)
- The device overview now lists variants of a device and other known marketing names in a more visible way, also allowing for different device information and instructions per variant to be shown
- The installation instructions have been paginated, giving users less chance to skip a section involuntarily

In addition to that we'd like to take this time to remind users to follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)
given the complexity introduced by AOSP changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab)
found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps.
As of 16.0, maintainers have been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's specific installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but are no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you complete it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission; and if it's up to par, you'll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS's official repositories.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki by adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

Also, if you sent a submission that didn't get a response in the last few months, please follow up, we've swapped providers again!

### Generic Targets

We've talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html)!

Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations, and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy Android 13/14/15) diverged GSI and Emulator targets. Emulator targets reside in `lineage_sdk_$arch`, while GSI targets reside in `lineage_gsi_$arch`.

Additionally, an experimental target now exists for virtIO (QEMU/crosvm/UTM, etc.) targets. Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on [the Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu).

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[our wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
