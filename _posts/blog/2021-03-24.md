## Ohai there, LineageOS 18.1

Man, it's been a while!

Firstly, hey, how are you doing? 2020 has been notably tough on all of us in different ways. Most of us were either stuck indoors,
or uncomfortably out and about for most of last year. It effected every industry, company, and project in a different way. Given
LineageOS has developers spanning the globe, our contributors all felt last year to varying extents - but what is a community if
not to be there for its members, and give them something to spend all that time stuck inside working on :).

With that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android 11's release last August to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google's fairly large changes in Android 10, we were able to rebase our changes onto Android 11 much more
efficiently. This led to a lot of time to spend on cool new features!

As always, let's talk about naming versioning - you may be thinking "Shouldn't this be 18.0, as AOSP is on 11, and not 11.1?".
As we stated in our last blog post, after 17.0 whenever we conduct a platform wide rebase, we will be incrementing our minor version.
So, when we rebased on the December Android Security Bulletin (ASB) due to its fairly massive changes, LineageOS 18.1 was born.

### New Features!

* September, October, November, December 2020 and January, February, March 2021 security patches have been merged to LineageOS 15.1 through 18.1.
  * Builds are currently based on the android-11.0.0_r32 tag, which is the Pixel series unified tag.
* Wi-Fi display is available for newer Qualcomm devices, on a device-by-device basis.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 89.0.4389.105.
* Our Recorder app has been vastly improved in more ways than can be counted, go leave yourself a voice-memo so you don't forget that great idea!
  * Screen recording has been moved to a QS tile to match AOSP's behavior.
  * The user interface has been revamped and there's also now an UI for easily viewing, managing and sharing your voice notes.
  * It is now possible to choose the quality of your audio recordings to save space.
  * It's now possible to pause and resume recordings.
* The FOSS [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar) app has been forked, improved, and shipped in place of the stagnant and largely unmaintained AOSP calendar.
* The Calyx institutes FOSS [SeedVault](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android) application has been included as a built in backup solution.
  * To use it, navigate to Settings -> System -> Backup, and "Change backup provider" to SeedVault. You can then click "Seedvault Backup" to configure, schedule, and encrypt backups!
* There is now an option on non-A/B devices to update the recovery image alongside the OS, just as the stock OS would!
  * To use this, either enable the option during the initial device setup, or navigate to Settings -> System -> (Show More) Updater -> Three Dot Menu in the top right -> and check "Update recovery alongside OS".
* Our music app, Eleven now has a more up-to-date UI and integrates nicely with all the new android features for music players such as seeking from the notification.
* All LineageOS apps now have support for dark mode.
* Our recovery now has a new, colorful, and fun UI that is much more accessible.
* (17.1 too) the firewall can block all connections now by making apps think that the device is in airplane mode
* (17.1 too) We've introduced a new expandable volume dialog UI.
* (17.1 too) The partial screenshots has had multiple feature additions, and ties in with AOSP's new "instant screenshot" feature.
* (17.1 too) Trebuchet now supports icon packs.
* (17.1 too) ADB root was reworked to ensure compatibllity with other 3rd party root solutions.

### TODO: Generic Targets
* Support for generic targets have been greatly extended! You can now build GSI's in both mobile and Android TV configurations, and even run them in the Android Emulator or Android Studio on your PC!

### Deprecations

On the whole, we feel that the 18.1 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 17.1 and is ready for initial release.

LineageOS 16.0 builds stopped on February 15th, 2021, to allow space on our infrastructure to begin testing LineageOS 18.1.

LineageOS 18.1 will launch building for a fairly wide selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 18.1

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

If you are installing from an unofficial build, you *MUST* wipe data from recovery before installing.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/), as given the complexity that AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab) found on the Pixel 5, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of 16.0, maintainers have
been expected to run through the full instructions, and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers given significantly more options to customize their device's individual installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices which were at one point official, but no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you review it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission, and if it's up to par, invited to our communications
instances, and your device forked to LineageOS's official repos.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach us out on Crowdin and we'll take necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymareg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
