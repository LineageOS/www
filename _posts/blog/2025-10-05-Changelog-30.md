## 23 - Primetime Release

Hey there! Welcome back!

We are _way_ ahead of schedule to say the least - and this last year has been a whirlwind to say the least! But we have remained dedicated to bringing an updated LineageOS based on Android 16 to the masses!

We've been hard at work rebasing all of our changes and features since Android 16's release in June, and yes you read that right, June! Android 16's original release mainly contained iterative improvements and some UI/UX refinement, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to rebase onto Android 16's code-base faster than anticipated.

Other components have complicated our release and security patching efforts, but we'll get to that shortly.

### Google's Patch Cadence, and LineageOS Going Forward

#### Firstly, what even is an ASB? Or a QPR?

- **ASB (Android Security Bulletin)** – Google’s monthly roundup of newly fixed security vulnerabilities across the Android ecosystem. Distributed as a list of patches and -security branch updates for older but still supported Android versions, with the current version tagged monthly. These updates let projects like ours and OEMs stay aligned with Google’s security baseline.
- **QPR (Quarterly Platform Release)** – Mid-cycle updates to a given Android version, landing every few months. QPRs bring not just security fixes but also bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature changes (like Material 3 Expressive in 16 QPR1).

#### Okay, why are you telling me this?

You’ll notice we are choosing to release LineageOS 23.0 — not 23.1. That’s because it’s based on Android 16’s initial release (what we’ll call QPR0), even though QPR1 has already rolled out to Pixels. The catch? Google never pushed QPR1’s source to AOSP. They’ve said it’ll come “in the coming weeks,” ([source]((https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-source-code-delay-3596650/))) but right now only contracted partners have access. And to answer the immediate question, the likelihood any custom ROM will ever be a contracted Google partner is near 0.

On top of that, Google’s handling of ASBs has shifted. July was empty for the first time since the program began, Augsust had a single patch, and September omitted patches for several listed vulnerabilities — with fixes shared privately to partners under embargo. Google has also stated they’ll no longer push monthly tags to AOSP, reserving most patches for quarterly drops that are not pushed to AOSP at the time of release.

This is why you've seen the LineageOS 22.2 security patch level remain reflective of August well into September.

In short: this cadence is now the norm, and we need to adapt.

#### And I heard that Google stopped pushing Pixel source?

Yes, Google has pulled back here too. Pixel kernels are now only offered as history-stripped tarballs, available privately on request — with no device trees, HALs, or configs. Thanks to projects like [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org), Pixels will likely remain well supported, but they’re no longer guaranteed “day one” devices for LineageOS. Pixel devices are now effectively no easier to support than any other OEM's devices.

In short, this just makes things harder, not impossible.

#### How does this effect LineageOS? And me?

It means we adapt. Instead of waiting indefinitely for QPR1’s source, we’re shipping 23.0 now on "QPR0", with the publicly available ASB patches applied, and we’ll only attest to a security patch level once we have access to all of its fixes. When QPR1 (and future QPRs) eventually land in AOSP, we’ll merge or rebase as appropriate.

This does mean some features — like Material 3 Expressive — aren’t here yet. But it ensures users get timely builds, the most complete security fixes we can legally access, and a clear path forward without limbo.

This will likely be the expected norm for Android 17 and beyond, so expect more `.0` releases in the future!

#### **TL;DR**:

- Google no longer pushes monthly tags and patches to AOSP; and most fixes/security patches are now pushed quarterly, if at all.
- Security patch levels may occasionally lag — we only increment them once all patches are public.
- LineageOS 23.0 is based on Android 16 "QPR0" because QPR1’s source isn’t public yet.
  - Because of this some headline features (like Material 3 Expressive) will come later, once sources drop.
- Pixel support continues, but with reduced source access, they’re no longer guaranteed, let alone on day one.

### Legacy Devices

The bad news extends a bit further here, though it’s less surprising than the earlier sections.

Google’s increased reliance on newer [**eBPF**](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf) features has made supporting devices with older Linux kernels increasingly difficult. Android 16 "QPR0" "requires Linux 5.4 and above, and at the time of writing, the necessary features have only been properly backported as far back as `4.19`.

Unfortunately, LineageOS 22.2 still supports many devices running `4.4`, `4.9`, and `4.14`. As of now, no complete backports of the required features exist for these kernels. The silver lining is that, unlike the massive device loss we saw moving off LineageOS 18.1, these versions *could* be salvaged if someone were to take on the work of adapting the backports. If you do succeed, please reach out to devrel(at)lineageos.org — we’d be happy to review it!

We're currently targetting only shipping kernels that have 1:1 eBPF backports to make them feature equivilant to Linux 5.4 from here on out to avoid compatibility issues.

### Back to the Good Stuff!

* Security patches from September 2024 to August 2025 have been merged to LineageOS 20 through 23.0.
* SeedVault and Etar have both been updated to their newest respective upstream version, with multiple fixes having been sent back to the relevant upstream repos!
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 140.0.7339.51.
* Contributor demon000 (Cosmin Tanislav) has started work on an awesome set of tools to assist maintainers in device bringups from scratch! They're still in-progress, but are staged to make a lot of our efforts signifigantly easier and more streamlined - so stay tuned! Maybe a rare non-yearly blog post? ;)
* Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for various VirtIO configurations (QEMU/crosvm/UTM/libvirt, etc.) targets! Though these aren't supported officially, there is an awesome, comprehensive guide for building and utilizing these targets on [the Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu). There is even a newer on allowing you to run LineageOS in a UTM virtual machine on an [Apple Silicon Mac](https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac)!
* Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for devices booting Android on the mainline Linux kernel! This will allow us to in theory boot LineageOS on almost all devices supoprted by the Linux kernel. It's in early phases, but very promising, with several sucessful device ports already available on the LineageOS GitHub organization! Check the search term "mainline" on the organization's searchbar.
* LineageOS is now nearly `Android.mk` free! Google announced their move from `make` to `soong` many years ago, pushing developers to migrate from Android.mk to Android.bp, and has started blocking Android.mk in many locations of the source tree.
  * While converting these is a seemingly simple task - in practice it involved countless hours of converting conditional checks, regression testing, and thousands of individual patches. As of the writing of this, LineageOS introduces less than 10 Android.mk at a platform level, and many of these are in the process of being converted. In short - we're ready for when Google kills support for Android.mk.

### New App, Again?

![catapult]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2025-10-05/catapult.webp){: .blog_post_image_content }

We’re excited to debut Catapult, our brand-new custom launcher for Android TV. Catapult is built with the same principles we bring to the rest of LineageOS: clean, simple, functional design, with thoughtful user experience at its core.

Why build a new launcher? For years, Android TV and Google TV users have been stuck with preloaded launchers that aggressively push advertising and recommendations users can’t control. Catapult changes that. It strips away the clutter, gives you back your home screen, and lets you decide what belongs front and center.

With Catapult, you get a fast, intuitive interface that focuses on *your* apps and *your* content — no forced feeds, no “sponsored” rows, just a launcher that works the way you expect.

We're also planning to add more features in the future, you'll see them appear as you keep your device up to date, stay tuned!

### Extended QEMU-Based Virtual Machine Support

LineageOS has long been a favorite for developers and tinkerers, and with 23.0 we’ve expanded support for virtualized environments. Thanks to extended QEMU integration spearheaded by developer 0xCAFEBABE, it’s now easier than ever to run LineageOS in VMs for testing, debugging, or just exploration. This means developers can spin up consistent environments on their desktops without needing dedicated hardware, and testers can reproduce tricky issues with greater reliability. Whether you’re validating patches or just curious to see how LineageOS runs under the hood, the tooling is smoother and more accessible.

If interested, take a look on [the Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu). You can run LineageOS via libvirt on Linux/Windows, and on an [Apple Silicon Mac](https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac) with UTM.

### Mainline Kernel Support

Another big milestone in 23.0 is our improved support for devices running Linux mainline kernels.

While Android has historically relied on heavily modified vendor kernels, the ecosystem is shifting toward mainline for long-term stability and maintainability.

With 23.0, developer 0xCAFEBABE has spearheaded an effort to extend compatibility for devices capable of booting the mainline Linux kernel, and we’ve made it easier for maintainers to bring their devices closer to upstream with inheritable common trees. The end result? For now, nothing, but in the future, hopefully being able to boot Android on _almost any_ device that is supported by the mainline Linux kernel.

This effort should help keep devices alive well past the point where their proprietary components stop working with newer Android releases.

See the following repos if interested! ([1](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_mainline), [2](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_common), [3](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_qcom-common), [4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_mainline_configs))

### Careful Commonization

Several of our developers have worked hard on SoC-specific common kernels to base on that can be merged on a somewhat regular basis to pull in the latest features/security patches to save maintainers additional effort.

Go check them out and consider basing your device kernels on them!

Supported SoCs right now are:

{: .table }
| SoC (system-on-chip) | Kernel Version | Android Version |
|------------------|------|
| Qualcomm MSM8998/MSM8996 | [4.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8998) | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm MSM8953 | [4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8953)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SDM845 | [4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm845)  | 13, 14, 15 |
| Qualcomm SM8150 | [4.14](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8150) | 13, 14, 15, 16 |
| Qualcomm SDM660 | [4.19](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm660) | 13, 14, 15, 16 |
| Qualcomm SM8250 | [4.19](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8250) | 13, 14, 15, 16 |
| Qualcomm SM8350 | [5.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8350)  | 13, 14, 15, 16 |
| Qualcomm SM8450 | [5.10](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8450)  | 13, 14, 15, 16 |
| Qualcomm SM8550 | [5.15](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8550)  | 13, 14, 15, 16 |

| Qualcomm SM8650 | [6.1](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8650)  | 14, 15, 16 |

| Qualcomm SM8750 | [6.6](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8750)  | 15, 16 |

Additionally, many legacy devices require interpolating libraries that we colloquially refer to as "shims" - these have long been device and maintainer managed, but this cycle we have decided to commonize them to make the effort easier on everyone and not duplicate effort!

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_compat) and contribute shims that you think other devices may need or add additional components to additional shims and compatibility layers provided via Gerrit!

### Deprecations

Overall, we feel that the 23.0 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 22.2 and is ready for initial release.

We will allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we no longer will allow newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.

LineageOS 23.0 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they meet the requirements specified by the
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md) and are made ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 23.0

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) and then on "Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS".

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) by clicking on your device and then on "Installation".

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Download portal

While it has been in the making for quite a while and already released two years ago, it's still relevant to this blog post.
Our [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) has been redesigned and gained a few functional improvements:

- Dark mode
- Downloads of additional images (shown for all devices but not used on all of them, read the instructions to know which ones you need for your device's installation!)
- Verifying downloaded files (see [here](https://download.lineageos.org/verify)) - if you go with any download not obtained from us, you can still verify it was originally
  signed by us and thus untampered with

A reminder: Follow the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) to the letter! If an image is listed on the download portal that the wiki doesn't ask you to use, ignore it! It is likely there so the maintainer can point power-users at it if needed.

### Wiki

The [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has also been expanded over the years and now offers, in addition to the known and tested instructions for all supported devices, some improvements:
- The device overview allows filtering for various attributes you might be interested in a device (please note that choosing a device only based on that list still does
  not guarantee any device support beyond the point of when you chose it)
- The device overview now lists variants of a device and other known marketing names in a more visible way, also allowing for different device information and instructions per variant to be shown
- The installation instructions have been paginated, giving users less chance to skip a section involuntarily

In addition to that we'd like to take this time to remind users to follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)
given the complexity introduced by AOSP changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab)
found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps.
As of 16.0, maintainers have been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's specific installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but are no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you complete it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission; and if it's up to par, you'll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS's official repositories.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help [improve them](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/contributing-apps/), or you can [contribute to the wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/contributing_wiki) by adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

Also, if you sent a submission that didn't get a response in the last few months, please follow up, we've swapped providers again!

### Generic Targets

We've talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html)!

Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations, and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator targets. Emulator targets reside in `lineage_sdk_$arch`, while GSI targets reside in `lineage_gsi_$arch`.

Additionally, an experimental target now exists for QEMU-based virtual machine softwares (libvirt, UTM, etc) targets. Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on [the Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu).

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[our wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
