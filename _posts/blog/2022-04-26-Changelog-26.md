## Wow, LineageOS 19!

As always, welcome back! When we wrote our post last year, I think many of us had thought we wouldn't be giving the same "trying times"
spiel we gave last year, but c'est la vie. From our family to yours, we hope you're navigating the pandemics and accompanying disasters
as swiftly and safely as possible!

With that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android 12's release last October to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google's fairly large changes in Android 11, we were able to rebase our changes onto Android 12L much more
efficiently. This led to a lot of time to spend on cool new features, as well as adapt our additions to Android 12's new [Material You](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) design language!

Now, let's talk about versioning conventions - To match AOSP's versioning conventions, and due to the fact it added no notable value to the end-user we are dropping our subversion from a branding perspective.

As Android has moved onto the quarterly maintenance release model, this release will be "LineageOS 19", not 19.0 or 19.1.

### New Features!

* Security patches from March 2021 to April 2022 have been merged to LineageOS 16.0 through 19.
  * 19 builds are currently based on the android-12.1.0_r4 tag, which is the Pixel 6 series tag.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 100.0.4896.127.
* We have completely redone the volume panel introduced in Android 12, and instead made it a side pop-out expanding panel.
* Our fork of the AOSP Gallery app has seen a large number of fixes and improvements.
* Our Updater app has seen a large number of bug-fixes and improvements.
* Our web browser, Jelly has seen a number of bug fixes and improvements!
* We have contributed a number of changes and improvements back upstream to the FOSS [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar) calendar app we integrated some time back!
* We have contributed a number of changes and improvements back upstream to the [Seedvault](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android) backup app.
* Our Recorder app has seen numerous bug fixes, improvements, and features added.
* Android TV builds now ship with an ad-free Android TV launcher, unlike Google's ad-enabled launcher.
* Android TV builds now ship with a key-handler that enables us to support custom-keys on a wide-array of bluetooth and IR remotes.
* Our `adb_root` service is no longer tied to the build type property.
* Our extract utilities now support extracting from most types of factory images/packed OTA images, simplifying device-bring up and blob-extraction greatly.
* Support for high-touch polling rate has been added to our SDK, allowing it to be enabled on supported devices.
* The AOSP Clang toolchain is now the default toolchain we use to compile our kernels.
* Qualcomm's Snapdragon Camera has been dropped, and devices that used it previously will now use Camera2.
* Dark mode is now enabled by default.
* We have an entirely new Setup Wizard, with all new Android 12 styled icons, animations, and ton of new configurable pages!
* We have a brand new set of icons for almost all apps, even system ones!
* (18.1 too) We have a whole new default wallpaper, and a full set of wallpapers to choose from, check them out! These wallpapers are designed with Android 12's Monet theming features in mind, so go try them out and see what accent color you like best!
* (18.1 too) Wi-Fi display is available for all devices which choose to opt-in, via either the Qualcomm proprietary interface or the newly restored legacy Miracast interface!
* (18.1 too) We now support custom charging sounds for different types of charging, cabled or wireless.

### Networking Restrictions

Our very popular privacy oriented built-in firewall, restricted networking mode, and per app data isolation features were all rewritten to account for AOSP's new restricted networking mode and [BPF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html).

Additionally, data restriction and network isolation features were merged into a single implementation.

Combined, this means that one of our largest pain points each bringup should now be easier to forward port in future revisions!

### Let's talk about legacy devices...

Bad news lies ahead, sadly. I know many of you were expecting the usual myriad of legacy devices to surprise you with a 19 release, but at the moment they won't be.

This is due to AOSP's removal of `iptables` in favor of [eBPF](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf). This is a newer, much more efficient kernel side implementation.

The issue lies in the fact that only devices with Linux kernel 4.9 or newer have the needed capabilities to make use of eBPF. Usually, these things can be backported to older kernel versions, but at the moment, even something as close to version 4.9 as 4.4 proved challenging due to the sheer number of commits and structure changes in BPF's introduction. Those of you on a 4.4 kernel, fear not, a backport has been created, but for devices using kernel versions 3.18 and below, this may be the end of the road. If you become aware of a functional backport, or create one yourself, feel free to let us know via devrel(at)lineageos.org!

Additionally, `iptables` can't be restored in any meaningful way, which makes things all the harder. At the moment, with some hacky workarounds (that we won't be merging, as they break packet filtering, etc.) legacy devices can boot, but until a proper workaround/backport of BPF is brought to older kernel versions, don't expect legacy devices to ship LineageOS 19.

### Deprecations

On the whole, we feel that the 19 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 18.1 and is ready for initial release.

LineageOS 17.1 builds stopped on January 31st, 2022, to allow space on our infrastructure to begin testing LineageOS 19.

LineageOS 19 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, mainly Google Pixel devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 19

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) as given the complexity introduced by AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab) found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of 16.0, maintainers have
been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's individual installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official, but are no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you review it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission; and if it's up to par, you'll be invited to our communications
instances, and your device will be forked to LineageOS's official repos.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other thing you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

Also, if you sent a submission via gmail over the last few months, due to some obscure issues, they didn't make it to us, so please resend them!

### Generic Targets

We've talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, in an effort to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html)!

Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations, and Android Automotive (we'll talk more about this later) making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

Please note that Android 12 diverged GSI and Emulator targets. Emulator targets reside in `lineage_sdk_$arch`, while GSI targets reside in `lineage_gsi_$arch`.

### Android Automotive!

Thanks to the hard work of contributors Tom Pratt and Al Sutton, LineageOS now supports Android Automotive build targets!

Note that this is Android Automotive, not the mobile device dependent Android Auto. You can read more about the difference [here](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive), but in essence, Android Automotive is a fully standalone car infotainment OS with extensible controls for common car peripherals.

Following the [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html) guide, you can build an Automotive GSI and try it for yourself!

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[our wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
