### Patreon

patron and help keep on infrastructure up and running. You can find our page

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anythinglingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach us out on Crowdin and we'll take necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymareg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our and your time.
