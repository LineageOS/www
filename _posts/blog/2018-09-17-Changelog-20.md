## Welcome to LineageOS’ regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since July 19th

* Email app has received several improvements including, but not limited to:
  * Wider attachments support
  * Per-folder notifications
  * Auto-Sync for multiple IMAP folders
  * Links and phone numbers in mail body are now clickable
* DIaler has got a lot of new features:
  * Call recording
    * This feature is not available in all the countries / devices. Remember that you are responsible for compliance with any laws, regulation and rules that apply to the use of this functionality and the distribution of those recordings
  * Call statistics
* Clock position can be customized (again)
    * On devices with a notch, the center position is not allowed, but you can still choose between left and right
* Updater can now install A/B updates faster by enabling the performance power profile for the installation process
* System Profile tile is back
* Jelly can now optionally block all clear-text traffic, making sure all the websites you visit are using a secure protocol such as https
* Vendor patch level date is now shown in “Device info” too
* It’s possible to customize the device hostname in developer options
* Data usage in quick settings panel now shows the correct amount of used data
* _.opus_ files are now supported in media players
* It is now possible to compile LineageOS 15.1 using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
* September security have been merged (15.1)
* August security patches have been merged (15.1, 14.1)

### LineageOS 16.0

The next iteration of LineageOS is already in the works: thanks to massive cleanup and refactoring done during the oreo bringup the transition to a newer android base is much smoother as
we’re able to re-introduce our features in an easier way as a good amount of them are almost “android-version agnostic”.

As always, we won’t be giving any indication as to when we might be close to a releasable product, but keep waiting patiently.

### Summer Survey 2

The second Summer Survey has ended and we’re reading all your feedbacks. Once we’re done we’ll post the results as we did [last year]({{site.baseurl}}Summer-Survey-Results/).

We’d like to thank all those who submitted their feedbacks, your contribution is really appreciated and it’ll help shape the development of the pie-based builds.
