One year ago, we created a [survey](https://lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/) in which
our users were able to send us feedback and suggestions. Features such as the Styles API, the new Trebuchet, and adaptive icons were developed with [your feedback](https://lineageos.org/Summer-Survey-Results/) in mind.

Your privacy is important to us, as such we do not run metrics on devices. In light of this, if you would like to contribute and provide your opinions, the window for doing so is now open.

### The survey

The survey is really simple and doesn't collect any personal information.
The results will be analyzed and will help us lay out a road-map for future feature implementations, while informing us about lesser used features we don't need to bother with.

We kindly ask you to be respectful of everyone: be honest and don't take
the survey more than one time, each person's opinion is equally important.

The survey will be closed in four weeks' time.

You can take the survey here below, and you can share it to your friends using
this link:

We're looking forward seeing your answers!
