One year ago, we created a [survey](https://lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/) where our users
would be able to send us feedbacks and suggestions. The Styles API, the new Trebuchet,
the adaptive icons and much more were developed with
[your feedback](https://lineageos.org/Summer-Survey-Results/) in mind.

We will never collect on-device metrics to understand what's good and what's bad about our software,
so if you want your chance to contribute and tip us and help us shape the next LineageOS iteration, here's it. 

### The survey

The survey is really simple and it doesn't collect any sensitive information. The results will be read and analyzed to help us focus on the right direction without wasting
resources on things nobody is interested in.

We kindly ask you to be respectful of everyone: be honest and don’t take
the survey more than one time, each one’s opinion is equally important.

 

The survey will be closed in four weeks' time.

You can take the survey here below, and you can share it to your friends using this link:

We’re looking forward to see your answers!
