## Welcome to LineageOSâ€™ regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since April 1st

### Leadership Changes

After roughly two years with Lineage, and another seven with CyanogenMod, we're sad to announce ciwrl is stepping away from the project to spend more time offline. We wish him the best!

We're also glad to announce that the current directors group have voted haggertk in as the ninth director. Welcome!
