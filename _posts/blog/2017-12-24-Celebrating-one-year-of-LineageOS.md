## Reviewing our first 12 months

One year ago, LineageOS was announced to the world.
We’d like to take the time to celebrate with our contributors, our users and our community.
This wouldn’t have been possible without all of you.

We would never have enough words to express how much we appreciate this community and how excited we are for the next year to come.
So instead, we've created an infographic, that we hope you all will enjoy.
