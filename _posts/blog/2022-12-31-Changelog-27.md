## 20 - wow. I remember when these releases were single digits...

Hey y'all! Welcome back!

As many of us start traveling again and the world returns to normal, of course, it's time for us to break the status quo! You probably
weren't expecting to hear from us until... somewhere near April according to our historical releases? HA! Gotcha.

With all that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android 13's release last October to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google's largely UI-based changes in Android 12, and Android 13's dead-simple device bring-up requirements, we were
able to rebase our changes onto Android 13 much more efficiently. This led to a lot of time to spend on cool new features such as our awesome new camera app, Aperture, which was
written in large part by developers SebaUbuntu, LuK1337, and luca020400.

Now, let's remind everyone about versioning conventions - To match AOSP's versioning conventions, and due to the fact it added no notable value to the end-user, we dropped our subversion from a branding perspective.

As Android has moved onto the quarterly maintenance release model, this release will be "LineageOS 20", not 20.0 or 20.1 - though worry not - we are based on the latest and greatest Android 13 version, QPR1.

Additionally, to you developers out there - any repository that is not core-platform, or isn't expected to change in quarterly maintenance releases will use branches without subversions - e.g., `lineage-20` instead of `lineage-20.0`.

### New Features!

* Security patches from April 2022 to December 2022 have been merged to LineageOS 17.1 through 20.
* `ohmagoditfinallyhappened` - LineageOS now has an awesome new camera app called Aperture! It is based on Google's (mostly) awesome [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) library and provides a much closer "to stock" camera app experience on many devices. Massive kudos to developers SebaUbuntu, LuK1337, and luca020400 who developed this initially, designer Vazguard, and to the entire team for working to integrate it into LineageOS and adapt it to our massive array of supported devices!
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 108.0.5359.79.
* We have introduced a completely redone volume panel in Android 13 and have further developed our side pop-out expanding panel.
* We now support GKI and Linux 5.10 builds with full out-of-tree module support to match new AOSP conventions.
* Our fork of the AOSP Gallery app has seen many fixes and improvements.
* Our Updater app has seen many bug fixes and improvements, as well as now has a fancy new Android TV layout!
* Our web browser, Jelly has seen several bug fixes and improvements!
* We have contributed even more changes and improvements back upstream to the FOSS [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar) calendar app we integrated some time back!
* We have contributed even more changes and improvements back upstream to the [Seedvault](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android) backup app.
* Our Recorder app has been adapted to account for Android's built-in features, while still providing the features you expect from LineageOS.
  * The app was rearchitected heavily.
  * Material You support has been added.
  * The high quality recorder (WAV format) now supports stereo and there has been several threading fixes.
* Android TV builds now ship with an ad-free Android TV launcher, unlike Google's ad-enabled launcher - we also support Google TV-style builds and are evaluating moving to it on supported devices in the future.
* Multiple Google TV features, such as the much more appealing looking Two-Panel Settings application have been ported to LineageOS Android TV builds.
* Our `adb_root` service is no longer tied to the build type property, which allows greater compatibility with many third-party root systems.
* Our merge scripts have been largely overhauled, greatly simplifying the [Android Security Bulletin](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin) merge process, as well as making supporting devices like Pixel devices that have full source releases much more streamlined.
* LLVM has been fully embraced, with builds now defaulting to using LLVM bin-utils and optionally, the LLVM integrated assembler. For those of you with older kernels, worry not, you can always opt out.
* A global Quick Settings light mode has been developed so that this UI element matches the device's theme.
* Our Setup Wizard has seen adaptation for Android 13, with new styling, and more seamless transitions/user experience.

### Amazing Aperture

Due to technical reasons, starting from LineageOS 19 we had to ditch Snap, our fork of Qualcomm's camera app, and began providing Camera2 again, the default AOSP camera app.

This led to a poor camera experience out of the box, since Camera2 is __too__ simple for the average user's needs.

So, with this LineageOS version, we wanted to fix this, and luckily for us [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera) reached a usable state, being mature enough to power a full-fledged camera app, so we started working on it.

After two and a half months of development, it can completely replace Camera2 and thus became the default camera app starting from LineageOS 20.

Aperture implements several features that are missing from Camera2, for example:

* Auxiliary cameras support (device maintainers must enable it)
* Video frame rate controls
* Full control of EIS (electronic image stabilization) and OIS (optical image stabilization) settings
* A leveler to check the device orientation angle

As time goes you might see new features introduced as the app's development is still ongoing!

### Careful Commonization

Several of our developers have worked hard on SoC-specific common kernels to base on that can be merged on a somewhat regular basis to pull in the latest features/security patches to save maintainers additional effort.

Go check them out and consider basing your device kernels on them!

Supported SoCs right now are:

{: .table }
| SoC (system-on-chip) | Kernel Version | Android Version |
|------------------|------|
| Qualcomm MSM8996 | [3.18](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8996) | 18.1 |
| Qualcomm MSM8998 | [4.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_msm8998) | 20   |
| Qualcomm SDM845 | [4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm845)  | 20   |
| Qualcomm SM8150 | [4.14](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8150) | 20   |
| Qualcomm SM8250 | [4.19](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8250) | 20   |
| Qualcomm SM8350 | [5.4](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sm8350)  | 20   |

Additionally, many legacy devices require interpolating libraries that we colloquially refer to as "shims" - these have long been device and maintainer managed, but this cycle we have decided to commonize them to make the effort easier on everyone and not duplicate effort!

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_compat) and contribute shims that you think other devices may need or add additional components to additional shims and compatibility layers provided via Gerrit!

### Deprecations

Overall, we feel that the 20 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 19.1 and is ready for initial release.

LineageOS 18.1 builds were not deprecated this year, as Google's somewhat harsh requirements of [BPF](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/bpf) support in all Android 12+ device kernels
meant that a significant amount of our legacy devices on the build-roster would have died.

Instead of killing LineageOS 18.1, it is on a feature freeze, while still accepting device submissions, and building each device monthly, shortly after the Android Security Bulletin is merged for that month.

LineageOS 20 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 20

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device, unless your device's wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive
changes, such as a repartition.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) as given the complexity introduced by AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic Partitions, and most recently [Virtual A/B](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab) found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of 16.0, maintainers have
been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device's specific installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but are no longer supported - seriously - even if it's not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you complete it.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission; and if it's up to par, you'll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS's official repositories.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki by adding
more useful information & documentation. [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for
submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

Also, if you sent a submission via Gmail over the last few months, due to infrastructural issues, some of them didn't make it to us, so please resend them!

### Generic Targets

We've talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.

Though we've had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we've documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android [Emulator/Android Studio](https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html)!

Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations, and Android Automotive (we'll talk more about this later) making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google's [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). We won't be providing
official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble's
requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!

Please note that Android 12 (and by-proxy Android 13) diverged GSI and Emulator targets. Emulator targets reside in `lineage_sdk_$arch`, while GSI targets reside in `lineage_gsi_$arch`.

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we'll take the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.
