## Hello, LineageOS 17.1

We have been working extremely hard since Android 10's release last August to port our features to this new version of Android.
Thanks to massive refactoring done in some parts of AOSP, we had to work harder than anticipated to bring some features forward,
and in some cases, introduced implementations similar to some of our features into AOSP (but we'll get to that later).

First, let's talk about naming versioning - you may be thinking "Shouldn't this be 17.0, as AOSP is on 10, and not 10.1?". and
given our previous versioning, you'd be correct. When the December Android Security Bulletin (ASB) dropped, we rebased on the
more feature filled Google Pixel 4/4 XL tag of AOSP. We decided that, in the future, if we decide for any reason to rebase a
large number of repos on a different tag, we will uprev our subversion, eg. 17.0 -> 17.1. As per this migration, on March 4th,
we locked all lineage-17.0 branches and abandoned existing 17.0 changes. Not to fear,
you can always cherry-pick your changes to 17.1, even via the Gerrit UI if you'd like!

### New Features!

* A new partial screenshot UI was implemented that lets you hand select smaller parts of your screen and edit the screenshots. So, feel free to go give it a "shot"!
* We know many of you have been waiting for news on themes since the CyanogenMod Theme Engine's deprecation in CyanogenMod 13.0, and those of you in this boat are in for a treat!
  * AOSP's new ThemePicker app was adapted to have the range of accents you've become used to with our old implementation, Styles.
  * We also opted to enable support for font change, icon shape (both QuickSettings and Launcher) and icon style changes (eg. changing the style of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth icons).
* Trebuchet has long been able to hide apps from the Launcher and protect them with a passcode/password, but now you can also use your biometric sensor to authenticate as well!
* October, November, December 2019 and January, February, March 2020 security patches have been merged.
  * Builds are currently based on the android-10.0.0_r31 tag, which is the Pixel 4/4 XL's tag.
* Wi-Fi display is available once again.
* Support for on-screen fingerprint sensors (FOD) has been added.
* Support for pop-up and rotating cameras has been added.
* Support for Australian English, Lithuanian, Latvian, Dutch, Romanian, Slovenian, Serbian and Turkish spell checking has been added to AOSP keyboard.
* AOSP keyboard available emojis have been updated to [Emoji 12.0](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-12.0/full-emoji-list.html).
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 80.0.3987.132.

### Lineage Recovery

Lineage Recovery is now the defacto install solution for LineageOS. It will be built by default for all official devices. This was done purely
to streamline the process and prevent having to coordinate releases. This is not at all to speak ill of other custom recoveries, they're great!
Several of them even contributed to Lineage Recovery in one way or another. Maintainers will, as always, be able to specify an alternative recovery
on their device's Wiki page, so long as they provide full instructions for its usage.

### Deprecations

* The [Styles API](https://wiki.lineageos.org/sdk/api/styles.html), is now deprecated in favor of the aforementioned ThemePicker app.
  * There is complete feature parity between the two, with ThemePicker now more fully featured!

* PrivacyGuard has been superseded by AOSP's new PermissionHub. It is almost equivalent in feature parity and directly conflicted with all attempts to forward-port Privacy Guard.
  * As a byproduct of this, our usual provided AddonSU zip to enable root access for the user is no longer feasible.
  * You're still welcome to use 3rd party root solutions, and we even have Lineage representatives in regular contact with heads of 3rd party root solutions to help maintain compatibility.
    * Please note that this **does not** mean that we support said solutions, and if you'd like to report a bug, we still need to know what 3rd party addons you're using on the ticket, and your problem may stem from said 3rd party addon.
  * For developers fretting this - no worries, ADB root is still available at the same old location.

* Expanded Desktop has been dropped in favor of the new AOSP navigation gestures.
  * Expanded Desktop API conflicted with AOSP gestures implementation now, and the framework part was hard to port due to big code refactor in AOSP.
  * Furthermore, the original implementation had a lot of issues in the past 2 android versions,
   for example tapping the power button or double tapping the screen did not wake up the device when Expanded Desktop was enabled,
   soft-key buttons did not appear when opening the keyboard and probably more.

On the whole, we feel that the 17.1 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 16.0 and is ready for initial release.
With 17.1 being the most recent and most actively developed branch, on April 1st, 2020 it will begin receiving nightly builds
and 16.0 will be moved to weekly builds.

LineageOS 17.1 will launch building for a small selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they are marked as both
[Charter](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) compliant and ready for builds by their maintainer.

### Upgrading to LineageOS 17.1

To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/upgrade_guides.html).

If you're coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole' install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/install_guides.html).

Please note that if you're currently on an official build, you *DO NOT* need to wipe your device.

If you are installing from an unofficial build, you *MUST* wipe data from recovery before installing.

### Importance of the Wiki

Though the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) has existed since our inception, we'd like to take this time to remind users to
follow instructions on their device's respective [Wiki Page](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/), as given the complexity that AOSP
changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, and the forthcoming [Dynamic Partitions](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/dynamic_partitions) found on the Pixel 4/4 XL, the instructions
many of you are used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps. As of 17.1, maintainers will
be expected to run through the full instructions, and verify they work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently extended, and
maintainers given significantly more options to customize their device's individual installation, update, and upgrade instructions.

### Developers, Developers, Developers

Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!

If you're a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it's easier than ever. Just follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html).

The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices which were at one point official, but no longer supported.

After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you'll receive some feedback on your device submission, and if it's up to par, invited to our communications
instances, and your device forked to LineageOS's official repos.

Don't have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? [Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html) is always open for submissions! Once you've contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we'll get you in the loop.

### Translations

Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?

If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/project/lineageos) and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach us out on Crowdin and we'll take necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymareg) language thanks to its community of translators.

Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.

### LineageOS 16.0 changelog

* Wi-Fi display is available once again.
* You may now route the hotspot connections through the device's VPN.
* Support for on-screen fingerprint sensors (FOD) has been added.
* Support for pop-up and rotating cameras has been added.
* Support for Australian English, Lithuanian, Latvian, Dutch, Romanian, Slovenian, Serbian and Turkish spell checking has been added to AOSP keyboard.
* It is now possible to compile LineageOS 16.0 on macOS.
* It is now possible to compile LineageOS 16.0 in the zsh shell.
* July, August, September, October, November, December 2019 and January, February, March 2020 security patches have been merged.
* WebView has been updated to Chromium 80.0.3987.132.
