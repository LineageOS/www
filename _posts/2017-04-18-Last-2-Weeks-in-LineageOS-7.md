## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### AOSP 7.1.2 Merge and April Security Patches
We've merged up the N branch to 7.1.2. This merge includes all AOSP security patches and features to the platform. Builds starting April 14th will include these.

### Major changes since the 3rd of April
* VoLTE [our new mascot](https://www.lineageos.org/Announcing-our-Mascot/) has taken an early retirement. No word yet on if he'll make a return.
* Fixes to the Extra Tiles we implemented a couple weeks ago:
  * Wakelock and service fixes that address increased battery usage problems
  * Changes in default state of several tiles
* Misc fixes around the platform as well as the usual device-specific fixes from all our awesome maintainers and contributors.
