## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### AOSP 7.1.2 Merge and April Security Patches
We've merged up the N branch to 7.1.2. This merge includes all AOSP security patches and features to the platform. Builds starting April 14th will include these.

### Major changes since the 3rd of April

* Android 7.1.2
* Fixed Extra Tiles issues leading to increased battery usage problems
* Many minor bugfixes
* Website and wiki are now using https by default
* [April fools](https://www.lineageos.org/Last-Week-in-LineageOS-6/) (VoLTE and Br0zip) are now gone

### Donations

You can now make Bitcoin donations, but for those who're not comfortable with this currency, we're working on setting up other platforms you can contribute to. To let you know how all those donations will be used, we've set up the [monthly LineageOS infra costs](https://wiki.lineageos.org/costs.html) wiki page.
