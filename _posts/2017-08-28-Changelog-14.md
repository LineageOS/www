## Welcome to LineageOS' regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

If you haven't seen our last post about our [Summer Survey](https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/), then take a look! You still have a week to feedback to us and tell us what you'd like to see improved or what you find fantastic.

### Major changes since August 8th

* Jelly
  * No longer crashes on non-http downloads
  * Incognito mode privacy is much improved
  * Back button no longer closes the app when search is open
  * URL bar no long overwrites search queries when the page is loading
  * Swiping down to refresh is now removed, due to problems when scrolling down on particular sites
  * More HTML5 features are now supported, including:
    * App caches
    * Local databases
* WEP WiFi encryption input now detects valid keys correctly
* Privacy Guard has seen a major overhaul. If you haven't heard of privacy guard, it's a way of denying certain permissions to particular apps. Check it out in `Settings > Privacy > Privacy Guard`
* You can jump directly to carrier selection from the homescreen using one of the Settings shortcuts
* Now, if you switch to the profile that is currently active, it resets all of its settings
* A number of crashes have been fixed in camera operations
* Volume buttons should no longer cause backlit hardware keys to light up
* New rewritten LineageOS updater app solving previous issues with downloading updates, such as failing half way through
* Situations where dialed numbers are hidden in the call log is now fixed
* Email app no longer crashes when changing notification lights settings

### Infrastructure

* CVE Tracker
  * CVEs and kernels can now be assigned tags, such as 'qcom' or 'broadcom', allowing the CVE list to be filtered
  * Actions are now logged in order to track when changes are made and by whom
  * We now have a favicon! How could we survive without?
  * CVEs statuses can now be reset across kernels, for instance if the previous fix is not valid, or another is needed
