## Welcome to LineageOS’ regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since September 23rd

* The ambient display quick settings tile should hide if it is not supported by the device
* Battery icon has been improved; the percentage will be show in battery saver mode when the “show percentage” option is set. The exclamation mark in the battery has also been given more contrast so it’s easier on the eyes
* October security patches have been merged for both LineageOS 14.1 and 13.0
* A number of Gallery force closes have been fixed
* Flashaholics should have an easier time selecting time and date in the Setup Wizard; the minimum date defaults to the date the zip was built
* Apps can now recognise our recorder app as being able to record sound
* Issues with the “Install” button being greyed out when installing APKs should now be fixed (REGRESSION-1262)
* KRACK Wi-Fi vulnerability has been fixed in both LineageOS 14.1 and 13.0
* The Calendar app now shows week start and end in the title when in week view, as well as showing the week of the year
* Bypassing the lockscreen by switching to a lockscreen-less profile from quick settings has been blocked
* Unofficial builds will now have the time of the build appended to their name
* The cLock app will now show the min/max temperatures on their own row in all cases

### LineageOS 15.0 (based on Android 8.0 Oreo)

Up to now, news on LineageOS 15.0 has been almost non-existant, but we're in a position now where we can document some of our progress here.

As many of you have seen (and I'm sure some of you are running them right now), a number of unofficial LineageOS 15.0 builds exist, some of which are built by our very own maintainers. 
These are in no way representative of a final product, but definitely let you all experience some of the features Android 8.0 has to offer.

Now that the basic framework is in place and devices are successfully booting LineageOS 15.0, some features are being brought forward, most of which are dependent on what was previously known as the CMSDK. 
A large focus while doing this has been to cut out and/or rebrand some of the relics from our predecessor CyanogenMod.

Our main focus right now is to move all of our work to Android 8.0.0 r23 (a large upgrade to Android 8.0.0 r3).

Like always, we're not going to be giving any indication as to when we might be close to a releasable product, but keep waiting patiently, and when we feel it is appropriate or we reach big milestones, we'll be giving you some more status updates.
