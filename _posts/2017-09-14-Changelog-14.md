## Welcome to LineageOS' regularly irregular review, where we go over changes in the last few weeks

### Major changes since August 8th

* LineageOS Updater app has been rewritten. Previous issues with downloading updates should be gone now
* Privacy Guard has received an user interface overhaul
* Burn-in protection (device-specific): statusbar and navigation bar (if any) icon's position is shifted every minute to help prevent burn-in of these areas
* AudioFX can now control reverb effect
* Jelly improvements, including more HTML 5 features support
* Disabled unused cmsdk services in builds
* Added carrier selection shortcut for Settings app, so you can jump to it right from your homescreen
* It's now possible to reapply the current system profile
* Volume buttons should no longer cause backlit hardware keys to light up
* Email is (back) able to customize notification lights settings for each email account
* WEP WiFi encryption input now detects valid keys correctly
* A number of crashes have been fixed in camera operations

## Security patches

While the September security bulletin has been [pubblished](http://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-09-01.html), the commits have not been pushed to AOSP so far. Among these, there's a fix for the newly discovered "[blueborne](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/)" vulnerability. We'll patch everything as soon as the new AOSP tag gets pushed.

### Survey

Our [summer survey](https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/) has ended. We'd like to thank everyone who took their time to provide advices and feedbacks. We'll share the results once we've analyzed the data in another post. Stay tuned!

### LineageOS 15.0 progress

While the cm-14.1 branch development hasn't stopped, we're also working on the next LineageOS version (15.0), based on the latest Android 8.0. We will refrain from giving any ETA, just patiently wait until the new branch is ready for release-time.
