## Finally it is coming

### Background
Since Aug. 2016, there have been lots of discussions about theme engine. Lots of users and themers urge us to add a theme engine but we did not release a plan until now.

### Why it is so late?
We want to stick to CMTE because it is battle-hardened and we DO NOT want to trash works of our talented member(Thank you, Clark, for your CMTE).

We had thought it is a smooth and quick process to bring CMTE up to N but unfortunately we are wrong. The CMTE bring up has been slow or at least slower than what we had hope.

### Recent internal discussions
Substratum solution drew our attention several months before and we had held several internal discussions about it. It was unstable and some of its functions broke our rules so we failed to reach a common view.

Recently we found it is changing and improving. Some of its issues were gone. It also proves that it is pretty stable on unofficial builds of LineageOS. Eventually, we reach a common view that we should choose Substratum solution.

### Our efforts
Based on recent internal discussions, we now found a special workgroup for Substratum. We invited representatives of Team Substratum and we are working closely with them to make Substratum match our needs.

### We don't give ETA. Keep Lineage and wait patiently. ;)
