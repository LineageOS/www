## Hello LineageOS-15.1

We've been working hard these months to get this new version available; the changes that were
done in upstream (AOSP) are huge: Project Treble changed the way hardware is managed from Android,
so all those OEM-abandoned platforms that are supported by Lineage had to be adapted for the new standards. 
Moreover, we've taken the time to make us future-proof by converting a lot of our hardware-related
code to make use of the new treble capabilities: things such as LiveDisplay and lights (leds) control
are now up to date with the new Android standards, so we're going to have an easier time
with forward-porting stuffs whenever a new Android version comes out. 

We've not spent all the time just forward-porting 14.1 features, the whole platform code
has been cleaned up: all the unused and deprecated bits have been removed and the rebrand process has been
completed. But we're also introducing some new features too; these were highly requested 
in the Summer Survey we held [last summer]({{site.baseurl}}/Summer-Survey/), so here's some of them:

#### Styles

You can now style some aspects of your device by selecting a custom accent color and by choosing between a light or dark interface. 
A really cool feature we've added to this is the (optional) integration with LiveDisplay: during the day the device will have a light theme, and whenever night mode kicks in, some of the interface elements will turn dark, so it's easier on the eyes. 
What if this isn't this enough? What if you want your device style to match your wallpaper colors? With _Automagic_ you'll be proposed the best color combination basing on your current wallpaper. 
While this is not a full theming replacement, we hope to satisfy users that requested simple theming capabilities.

#### New Trebuchet launcher

Our homegrown launcher has been rewritten to make it more up to date with Android standards. Some redundant features have been removed and new ones such as icon packs support have been added.
All our apps have received a new adaptive icon too, thanks to the feedback you provided in the Summer Survey (you can see a preview of them in the image above). 
Moreover, Trebuchet will allow you to choose the shape that suits your likes from circle, super ellipse, squircle and teardrop.

#### QR support in Snap camera

There's now a QR reader mode in our camera app, which supports QR-encoded URLs, plain text, SMS, email addresses, contacts cards, events, phone numbers and location coordinates.

### Upgrading to 15.1

We're starting our 15.1 builds with some devices (listed below), with others migrating to 15.1 sooner or later. Note that older devices are unable to receive official builds at this time due to the lack of support for working HAL1 camera recorder, which was broken by the treble changes, but don't worry - we're working on it.

#### From official LineageOS 14.1

 1. Download the build either from [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org) or built in updater app
   * You can export the downloaded package to the sdcard from the updater app by long-pressing it and then selecting _"Export"_ on the top menu
 2. Download proper addons packages (gapps, [su](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)...) for Oreo.
 3. Make sure your recovery is up to date.
 4. Boot into recovery mode 
 5. Format your system partition
 6. Install the LineageOS 15.1 build, then install all your addons WITHOUT rebooting.
 7. When you're done, reboot the device. 

Note that: 

 * Wiping data is _not_ needed when upgrading from an official build
 * The updater app will not allow you to install a 15.1 build on the top of a 14.1 one automatically

#### From anything else (including unofficial LineageOS builds)

 1. Download the build from [download portal](https://download.lineageos.org).
 2. Download proper addons packages (gapps, [su](https://download.lineageos.org/extras)...) for Oreo.
 3. Make sure your recovery is up to date.
 4. Boot into recovery mode and wipe data. 
 5. Install the LineageOS 15.1 build, then install all your addons without rebooting.
 6. When you're done, reboot the device. 

Note that wipe data is _always_ needed when coming from something that's not an official build, regardless of the Android version

## Older versions changes
* LineageOS 14.1
  * Jelly's favorites management has been improved
  * December 2017 and January 2018 security patches have been merged
  * Webview has been updated to Chromium 63.0.3239.111
* LineageOS 13.0
  * December 2017 and January 2018 security patches have been merged

## Goodbye LineageOS 13.0
The Marshmallow-based release has been discontinued and the last builds were published on Feb 11th, 2018. The branches will not be locked, so it’ll still be open for contributions such as security patches, like the 11.0 branch which has been getting security patches backported from the community. LineageOS 14.1 will remain under active development, but don’t expect new features to come since the majority of the team has jumped to the Oreo branch.

## Infrastructure
A couple of our infrastructure repos have been moved from the [LineageOS organization](https://github.com/LineageOS) to the [LineageOS-Infra organization](https://github.com/lineageos-infra) on GitHub.
The wiki has also been updated with a focus on device information since a lot of users often check it to look for a suitable device that's also capable of running LineageOS

## Device support: new rules
Beginning with LineageOS 15.1, we’re enforcing a set of rules defined by the [LDSR](https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md) (LineageOS Device Support Requirements). This document defines the requirements that must be met in order for devices to be deemed ship-ready for LineageOS releases to maintain a higher quality standard. These rules, which are not retroactive (so 14.1 won’t be affected), will apply to all the devices that want to ship a LineageOS 15.1 official release (no matter if they had a 14.1 build or not).
