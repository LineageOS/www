## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### Major changes since the 2nd of May

* Gello has been abandoned in favour of Jelly (our new lightweight browser), as this is a project we no longer have the resources to maintain
  * If you'd like to use a Chromium-based browser, there a number of alternative 3rd party OSS browsers such as Chromium
* FlipFlap can now be disabled from within the app
* Incorrect call times being recorded and displayed in Dialer has been fixed
* Fixed a crash in some 3rd party apps that use the camera under some circumstances
* The autobrightness toggle, found in Quick Settings next to the brightness slider, can now be toggled in _Settings > Status bar > Auto brightness_
* Webview has been updated to use the Chromium 58 base

### CVE tracker

If you didn't know, Google releases a set of security updates monthly, which fix a number of CVEs (security vulnerabilities). These aren't always in the upper layers of Android, and are typically in the kernel.

Because of this, it can be difficult to record exactly which devices, as a developer, have been patched against particular vulnerabilities. Our [CVE tracker](https://cve.lineageos.org), which was previously private is now publically accessible (as read-only), primarily for the use of developers not currently part of the Lineage team who would like to patch their kernels against security vulnerabilities.

### Build roster
