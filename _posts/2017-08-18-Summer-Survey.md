While the project's development proceeds, we think it's important to take a moment and get some feedback our users. 
It's been decided to create a simple survey, instead of collecting on-device metrics, to help us improve LineageOS 
in the right direction without wasting resources on things that our userbase is not interested in. 

The survey is really simple and we won't collect any sensitive information. 
We kindly ask you to be respectful of everyone: don't take the survey more than one time, each one's opinion is equally important. 
The survey will be closed in two weeks' time. 

### Topics 

We've divided this survey into 5 topics:

1. Apps
2. Wallpapers
3. Features
4. Infrastructure
5. Public relations


You can take the survey here below, and you can share it to your friends using this link: [goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2](https://goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2) 

We're looking forward to see your answers!

The LineageOS team
