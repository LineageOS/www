While our project's development proceeds, we think it's important to take a moment and get some feedback from our users. 
It has been decided to create a simple survey to help us improve LineageOS in the right 
direction without wasting too many resources on things that our userbase is not interested in, instead 
of collecting on-device metrics. 


We've divided this survey into 5 topics:

1. Apps
2. Wallpapers
3. Features
4. Infrastructure
5. Public relations


The survey is really simple and we won't collect any sensitive information, and while it's being hosted on Google Modules, we won't ask you to log in through your Google account. 
We kindly ask you to be respectful of everyone: don't take the survey more than one time, each one's opinion is equally important. 
The survey will be closed in two weeks' time.

You can take the survey here below, and you can share it to your friends using this link: [goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2](https://goo.gl/forms/4phLuXIWHUr3s4Qf2)
We're looking forward to your answers!

The LineageOS team
