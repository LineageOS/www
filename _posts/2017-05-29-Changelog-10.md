## Welcome to LineageOS' biweekly review, where we go over changes in the last couple of weeks

### Major changes since the 15th May

* Lots of small Jelly tweaks and improvements
* WiFi is now enabled on first boot after a factory reset, preventing a crash in our Setup Wizard further in the setup
* Select sensitive numbers are no longer written to the call log
  * In the EU, some numbers are intentionally not shown on phone bills, in order to allow hotlines dealing with domestic violence or similar situations to be called with confidence
  * In LineageOS, a list of particular numbers (available to view [here](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_vendor_cm/blob/cm-14.1/prebuilt/common/etc/sensitive_pn.xml) - this will be continually updated) will no longer be written to the call log viewable in the Dialer app
  * We would appreciate if you know of any other sensitive numbers in your country - particularly those dealing with child abuse, domestic abuse, or sexual assault hotlines - to submit these to [Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org), in a similar fashion to these commits: [Brazil](https://review.lineageos.org/174954), [Bangladesh](https://review.lineageos.org/175114), [Turkey](https://review.lineageos.org/175119), [US](https://review.lineageos.org/175115)
* The CVE tracker (which we mentioned in our [last changelog post](https://lineageos.org/Changelog-9/)), has been made properly public. You can view it [here](https://cve.lineageos.org)
  * To clear up some confusion, to modify values here, you have to be signed into a GitHub account that is part of the LineageOS organisation on GitHub - a privilege withheld for those who are part of the Lineage team
  * Also bear in mind, that this does not analyse the kernel repository. The device maintainer must mark particular CVEs patched themselves
* AudioFX should now be much more responsive, and free of some of the lag suffered when moving between various effects
* The customisable right lockscreen shortcut now has identical behaviour and appearance to the left one, so now longer appears black, and correctly inherits the icon's primary colour as the background
* A potential memory leak and/or memory corruption exploit with our recent su hide patches (which you can read more about in our [last changelog post](https://lineageos.org/Changelog-9/)) has been fixed

### SafetyNet and LineageOS

Recently, Google have added an option to the app developer console, so that app makers can now choose to make their apps available only to devices that passed SafetyNet. This means the app *will not appear in searches* on the Google Play Store with devices that do not pass SafetyNet.

Our official stance is that *we're not going to do anything about this*. All the solutions proposed would involve some form of lying to SafetyNet and/or the Google Play Store, with everyone ending up on the losing side. If an app that you use is affected by such a block, we recommend you pursue alternative methods of installing this app.


### Build roster

Added 14.1 devices

* [Google Nexus 4 - mako](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/mako) - no longer actively maintained

We'd like you to remember that all the devices that are removed from the build roster are just waiting for a new maintainer for nightlies to continue. If you're interested in maintaining a dropped device, patch it and then [submit your work to Gerrit](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting-patch-howto.html), your contributions will be welcome.
