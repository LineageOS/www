That’s because it’s based on Android 16’s initial release (what we’ll call QPR0), even though QPR1 has already rolled out to Pixels. The catch? Google never pushed QPR1’s source to AOSP. They’ve said it’ll come “in the coming weeks,” ([source]((https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-source-code-delay-3596650/))) but right now only contracted partners have access. And to answer the immediate question, the likelihood that any custom ROM will ever be a contracted Google partner is near 0.\n```",

July was empty for the first time since the program began, August had a single patch, and September omitted patches for several listed vulnerabilities — with fixes shared privately to partners under embargo. The result is that AOSP security updates are no longer released in full on a monthly basis. Instead, only high and critical severity CVEs are published in the monthly ASBs, and even then, the underlying patches are often not made public immediately.\n\nOn a quarterly cadence, Google now issues larger security bulletins that include patches for vulnerabilities originally discovered in prior months. For the latest Android version, these quarterly bulletins coincide with QPRs (Quarterly Platform Releases), which bundles those security fixes together with feature updates, but also often are not pushed to AOSP at the time of release.\n```",
